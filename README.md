# 👋 Hi there, I'm Deniz Efe Karacakaya

## 👨‍💻 About Me
I'm an enthusiastic AI and data science learner based in Turkey. I’m passionate about transforming data into insight, and exploring how artificial intelligence and machine learning can help solve real-world problems.

Currently, I’m actively participating in AI-focused bootcamps and hands-on workshops to deepen my knowledge in Python 🐍, data analysis 📊, machine learning 🤖, and geospatial technologies 🛰️.

One of my most recent experiences was during the AI Workshop organized by BTK Akademi, where I had the opportunity to work under the mentorship of Dr. Murat Altun. Using Python’s leafmap library, I conducted a satellite-based before/after image comparison study of forest fire-affected areas in Bodrum and Mumcular. This project allowed me to combine environmental awareness with technical skills in geospatial AI 🌱💻.

I am always eager to learn, collaborate, and contribute to projects in artificial intelligence, data science, and sustainability-driven technology. My focus areas include:

- 🤖 Artificial Intelligence  
- 📊 Data Science  
- 🧠 Machine Learning  
- 🛰️ Geospatial Analysis  
- 🐍 Python Programming  

I'm passionate about turning data into meaningful insights and applying AI for solving real-world problems — especially in the fields of sustainability and environmental analysis.

## 🧪 Recent Work

One of my most exciting recent experiences was during the **AI Workshop by BTK Akademi**, where I worked under the guidance of **Dr. Murat Altun**.  

In this project, I used Python’s `leafmap` library to create **Before/After Image Comparison** visualizations of forest fire-affected regions in Bodrum and Mumcular.  

- 🔥 In **Torba (Bodrum)**, I analyzed satellite images showing reforestation progress after a 2000 fire that damaged 305 hectares.  
- 🌲 In **Mumcular**, I examined the results of a 2006 fire that affected over 2,600 hectares, later restored by planting 4 million red pine saplings.

This project helped me connect environmental awareness with technical skills in geospatial AI.
